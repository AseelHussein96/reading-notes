# Intro OF JavaScript:
*Access content*: we use javascript to select any element or attribut for html text page to run my page 
you start use <h> to write head text in html then write id inside to make it run in javascrpit. and id its use
  it for one element and class attribute for more than one.
  *modify content*: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the
page.
  *program rule*: it will cheak for you if it will be use write at javascript like A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform calculation, and display repayments.
  *react to events* : you can chose the script should be run to sprcific event like you will add a buttom to run 
  or link to open it.]
  javascript you used it to make your web become better look or make update for your webpage to be more useful 
  and use it better.
  # Examples of javascript in the browser :
  > slideshows 
  > forms
  > reload part of page
  > filtering data
  
  # HTML AND CSS:
  Html element to add a constant elements to my page its like a basic of my web,it have attributs
  write to help me make simple structure of my web.
  but i need to design my web to be look more good or to be nice looker for user to that we go to css.
  css have selector to select the elment want to change then theres a declaration block it contain color or type 
  # first we must understand javascript:
  JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user
  to write scripts you need to write first your goal and draw it to achive your order.
  you must start with big picture of what you want to achive your goal must follow some steps:
  1. write your goal and explain it.
  2. design the script:You can then write down individual steps that the
computer needs to perform in order to complete
each individual task (and any information it needs to
perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it
can follow. 
3. Code each step: you must wite code for every step you need to do it.

# Experession: it use to design single value,theres two type:
*val for word or i can used it to perfome any number.
# operation:An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.
# javascript contain mathemtic operation which you can use this number.
* addition + ,subtraction -, divtion /....
# ORDER OF EXECUTION
Several arithmetic operations
can be performed in one
expression, but it is important
to understand how the result
will be calculated.

# function : A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
* JavaScript a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A function can be defined using function keyword and can be executed using () operator. A function can include one or more parameters.
