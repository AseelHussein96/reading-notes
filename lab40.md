## Because everything around us work in computer so in this summery i will talk about how computer work and how informtion come in and out of the computer and about visual site of computer.he computer as we know it today had its beginning with a 19th century English mathematics professor name Charles Babbage. He designed the Analytical Engine and it was this design that the basic framework of the computers of today are based on.
# HOW COMPUTER WORKS? 
- like how i say computer everywhere every place in the world cause that must think about it was a computer or how it come and how it work if we look will see all computer work in 4 commom things.
first are input the data then storage after that make processing and then output data.
* input in computer are mouse kepoard any thing that use to inter data to computer or voice.
* storage: computer processor its takes information form memory then sen the proccessed infromation back to be stored in memory and it continues until the data be ready to be output.
* output : the output it became diffrent from computer to anthor it may be like a photo or voice and somtimes if we conect to internet my input became output to other.
# Data and binary :
- computer language its 0 and 1 or you can say computer talk 0 1 language like how we spake arabic.EXAMPLE: 0 1 like true or false but bt bit will give you one wire to use at computer if you get more bits more complex informatiom.but if one ask you how i can count by just two number theres thing called *binary numeral system* its a stander systeam use to represented any number to 0 1.
# circites:
Any circites will take a electric signal then flips it its use a 0 for close and 1 for open.must complicted ciruts take a multiple signals and then combine them to give you qa driffent result of output. 
- theres many circuits there arei *and* /*not*/*nor*/*or*. 
- circutes will turn every signl to website video music and games.
# cpu,memory,input and output: 
- every computer have same proces no one diffrent than other,input its a converts a physical input to binary information them memory come to store information after and tell the cpu to convert information to 1 0 , cpu to center processing unit calculates information and changing to 0 1 after all calcultion is done out come and convertes information to physical output.
# Hardwear and softwear: 
- Hardwear any thing you can see or touch its a physical device used  in your machine.hardware is something you can hold in your hand.
* Hardwear are chips,circult,wire,spekers..
- softwear: software is a collection of programming code installed on your computers where you cant see it or handl it.
