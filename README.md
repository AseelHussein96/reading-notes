  > Theres 3 reminders i said to my self to keep my mindset growth: 
 
    - Think realistically about time :
It takes time to learn. Don’t expect to master every topic on one time.

    - Make new goal every day :
  You’ll never be done learning. Just because your midterm exam is over doesn’t mean you should stop being interested in a subject. Growth-minded people know how to constantly create new goals to keep themselves stimulated.
  
    - Stop seeking approval :
   When you prioritise approval over learning, you sacrifice your own potential for growth.
